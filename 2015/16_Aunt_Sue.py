# --- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---
#
#
# Your Aunt Sue has given you a wonderful gift, and you'd like to send her a
# thank you card. However, there's a small problem: she signed it "From, Aunt
# Sue".
#
# You have 500 Aunts named "Sue"
#
# So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out
# which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave
# you the gift. You open the present and, as luck would have it, good ol'
# Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine! Just what you
# wanted. Or needed, as the case may be.
#
# The My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM for short) can detect a
# few specific compounds in a given sample, as well as how many distinct
# kinds of those compounds there are. According to the instructions, these
# are waht the MFCSAM can detect:
#  - children, by human DNA age analysis.
#  - cats. It doesn't differentiate individual breeds.
#  - Several seemingly random breeds of dogs: samoyeds (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoyed_dog), pomeranians (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeranian_dog), akitas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita_%28dog%29),
#  and vizslas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizsla).
#  - goldfish. No other kinds of fish.
#  - trees, all in one group.
#  - cars, presumably by exhaust or gasoline or something.
#  - perfumes, which is handy, since many of your Aunts Sue wear a few
#  kinds.
#
# In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these. You put the wrapping
# from the gift int othe MFCSAM. It beeps inquisitively at you a few times
# and then prints out a message on ticker tape (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_tape):
#   children: 3
#   cats: 7
#   samoyeds: 2
#   pomeranians: 3
#   akitas: 0
#   vizslas: 0
#   goldfish: 5
#   trees: 3
#   cars: 2
#   perfumes: 1
#
# You make a list of the things you can remember about each Aunt Sue. Things
# missing from your list arenÃ¬'t zero - you simply don't remember the value.
#
# What is the number of the Sue that got you the gift?

#
# As you're about to send the thank you note, something in the MFCSAM's
# instructions catches your eye. Apparently, it has an outdated
# retroencarbulator (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w), and so the output from the machine isn't exact values -
# some of them indicate ranges.
#
# In particular, the cats and trees readings indicates that there are greater
# than taht many (due to the unpredictable nuclear decay of cat dander and
# tree pollen), while the pomeranians and goldfish readings indicate that
# there are fewer than many (due to the modal interaction of
# magnetoreluctance).
